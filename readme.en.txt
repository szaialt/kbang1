Compilation needs Qt5, Qt4 is not good for it.

You can choose the option Our rules. So you get those:
* Dynamit cann't be throwen out.
* Life-saving beer even with two players.
* Suzy Lafayette can use only one weapon during a turn.
* Suzy Lafayette can't switch her table cards but others yes.

Double dynamite can be separately set. 

Some characters are missing from technical reasons. 

To use ability of Jesse Jones, you need to clik to a free place on table of the target player. Another characters with target player need click to any card of their target.

You can modify character list by modifying characterlist.cpp. To modify the deck, you need modify cardfactory,cpp. If you would change a card, you need replace the card with a new card with the same name on the right place.
