/**
 * The PlayingCard is the base class for all playing cards. The each playing
 * card has the following attributes:
 *  * id   - the unique identifactor of the card
 *  * type - e.g. Bang!, Missed, ...
 *  * suit - e.g. Diamonds, Spades, ...
 *  * number - e.g. 7, K, A
 *
 * Moreover, every card also rembembers where it's located. This is sufficiently
 * represented by storing the owner and the pocket. The class that moves cards (the
 * GameTable class) is responsible to maintain these values correct.
 *
 * Despite the differences between playing cards in Bang, every card can be played
 * somehow. By playing it's meant taking the card from the player's hand and putting it
 * to the discard pile, in front of the player, in front of another player, etc. In some
 * cases it's necessery to add some extra information while playing the card. It can be
 * the another card or another player. For this action the PlayingCard provides the
 * "play" interface:
 *  * virtual void play();
 *  * virtual void play(Player* targetPlayer);
 *  * virtual void play(PlayingCard* targetCard);
 *
 * Not every card (in fact none card) has to support all the methods. In case of using improper
 * method, the BadUsageException should be returned.
