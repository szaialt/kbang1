/**
 * The Player class represents a Bang! player. The players are created by the Game
 * instance by calling CreateNewPlayer and are destroyed at the end of the game,
 * or before the game starts (typically when the client leaves the game before it
 * starts).
 * Note, that Players cannot be destroyed during the game, thus the disconnection
 * of a client leads either to the premature end of the game, or the current client
 * is replaced with another controller, for example an AI controller or another client.
 *
 * The Player class holds all important player's data, including the player's cards,
 * life points, role, character, etc. Every player has also an unique id (that is also
 * used in network communication with clients).
 *
 * The players can be controlled by controllers. A player controller is a class that
 * implements the GameEventListener interface and acquires the PlayerCtrl instance. A
 * basic controller is the Client class that forms an adapter between remote clients
 * and player controller API.
