/**
 * This class is a type of a card in Bang! game. The whole set of Card instances
 * is created during the start of the client. This class manages lifetime of its
 * objects by itself. It's only sufficient to create an instance with \b{new}
 * operator and you should never free any instances with \b{delete} operator by
 * yourself.
 *
 * Cards can be then looked up by their id string. The identification of common cards
 * is specified in KBang specification, so you can use card identification that you
 * got from server (more specifically the parser class) to get the card object.
 *
 * The Card class is almost exclusively used in the CardWidget class.
 * @see client::CardWidget
 *
 * \note In future it may be possible to use different card sets. This will be
 *       implemented by adding a kind of card-set-manager class that will manage
 *       creating the Card objects.
