Description 	
English: "FinnDot" telescopic sight reticle.

The Finnish Defence Forces (FDF) 8.6 TKIV 2000 rifles have custom made Zeiss 3-12x56 Diavari VM/V T* 30 mm telescopic sights with eye safe laser filters mounted. These sights are equipped with first focal plane "FinnDot" reticles (a regular mil-dot reticle with the addition of 400 m – 1200 m holdover (stadiametric) rangefinding brackets for 1 meter high or 0.5 meter wide targets at 400, 600, 800, 1000 and 1200 m). Reticle illumination is provided by a tritium ampoule embedded in the elevation turret.
The reticle elevation has 0.25 mil (0.25 mrad) adjustment intervals (total elevation range = 18.6 mils), while the windage has 0.1 mil adjustment intervals. The FDF thinks 0.25 mil elevation intervals are easier and quicker to use with Arctic mittens and that the difference between 0.1 and 0.25 mil adjustment intervals is negligible for anti-personnel sniping (0.1 mil at 1400 m = 14 cm (0.3437747 MOA), 0.25 mil at 1400 m = 35 cm (0.8594367 MOA)).
The elevation turrets have 100 m – 1400 m Bullet Drop Compensation (BDC) knobs calibrated for the Lapua Lock Base B408 cartridges the FDF issues its 8.6 TKIV 2000 marksmen. FDF snipers are trained to compensate BDC induced errors that inevitably occur when the environmental and meteorological circumstances deviate from the circumstances the BDC was calibrated for.
All vital screw slots on the telescopic sight are designed to be operated with the rim of .338 Lapua Magnum cartridges instead of screwdrivers.

A tornado near Anadarko, Oklahoma. The funnel is the thin tube reaching from the cloud to the ground. The lower part of this tornado is surrounded by a translucent dust cloud, kicked up by the tornado's strong winds at the surface. The wind of the tornado has a much wider radius than the funnel itself.

Summary
This image is taken from the Public Health Image Library (PHIL), a division of the CDC. The description of the image specifically states that it is in the public domain: "This image is in the public domain and thus free of any copyright restrictions. As a matter of courtesy we request that the content provider be credited and notified in any public or private usage of this image." It is credited to Edward J. Wozniak D.V.M., Ph.D. I downloaded the high-resolution TIFF from the website and re-saved it in the PNG format (compression level 9) using GIMP. This reduced the file size by about half while resulting in no loss of visual information. Original URL: [1]. Due to the extensive use of server-side scripting on the PHIL website, it is impossible to link directly to the image description page, but it can easily be located by going to this search page and entering the image ID (8131) in the search box.
